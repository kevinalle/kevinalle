INTRODUCTION


The ScaLAPACK installer is a set of python scripts developed to ease
the installation of the ScaLAPACK library. It can automatically
download, configure and compile the ScaLAPACK including all its
dependencies that are BLAS, LAPACK and BLACS libraries. All it needs
is the mpi C and FORTRAN compilers mpicc and mpif77 (note that the
names of these compilers may be different than mpicc and mpif77 on
some systems). Please note that this is an alpha version and, even if
it has been tested on a wide set of systems, may not work. In case you
encounter a problem, your feedback would be greatly appreaciated and
would be very useful to improve the quality of this installer.
Please submit your complaints and suggestions to scalapack@cs.utk.edu
or on the lapack/scalapack forum: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/

INSTALL

Here's a list of the flags that can be used to provide the installer
information about the system like, for example, the mpi compilers, the
libraries that are already present on the system and need not be downloaded.

          
          -h or --help         : prints this message

          --prefix             : path where to create the libraries, build and log of the installer

          --mpibindir=[DIR]    : the path to where the mpi
                                 binaries (mpicc and mpif77)
                                 are contained

          --mpicc=[CMD]        : the mpicc command.
                                 (default: will take the first available mpicc in the path)

          --mpif77=[CMD]       : the mpif77 command.
                                 (default: will take the first available mpif77 in the path)

          --f90=[CMD]          : the Fortran 90/95 compiler.
                                 A Fortran 90/95 is required only in the case where LAPACK has to be
                                 installed, i.e., the --downlapack flag was provided.

          --mpiincdir=[DIR]    : the path to the directory containing mpi.h
                                 (default: will take the corresponding mpi.h to the mpicc/mpif77 found)

          --ccflags=[FLAGS]    : the flags for the C compiler
                                 (default -O3)

          --fcflags=[FLAGS]    : the flags for the F77 compiler
                                 (default -O3)

          --f90flags=[FLAGS]   : the flags for the F90/95 compiler
                                 (default -O3)

          --noopt=[FLAGS]      : compilation flags to be used
                                 on machine dependent subroutines
                                 in LAPACK and ScaLAPACK.
                                 See LAPACK and ScaLAPACK documentation.

          --ldflags_c=[flags]  : loader flags when main program is in C. Some compilers (e.g. PGI) require 
                                 different options when linking C main programs to Fortran subroutines
                                 and vice-versa

          --ldflags_f77=[flags]: loader flags when main program is in Fortran 77. Some compilers (e.g. PGI) require 
                                 different options when linking Fortran main programs to C subroutines
                                 and vice-versa

          --ldflags_f90=[flags]: loader flags when main program is in Fortran 90/95. Some compilers (e.g. PGI) require 
                                 different options when linking Fortran main programs to C subroutines
                                 and vice-versa

          --makecmd=[CMD]      : the make command
                                 (make by default)

          --blacslib=[LIB]     : the BLACS library
                                 (path should be absolute if --prefix is used)

          --blacsclib=[LIB]    : the BLACS C interface library
                                 (path should be absolute if --prefix is used)

          --blacsf77lib=[LIB]  : the BLACS F77 interface library
                                 (path should be absolute if --prefix is used)

          --blaslib=[LIB]      : a BLAS library
                                 (path should be absolute if --prefix is used)

          --lapacklib=[LIB]    : a LAPACK library
                                 (path should be absolute if --prefix is used)

          --downblas           : if you do not want to provide a BLAS
                                 we can download and install it for you

          --downblacs          : if you do not want to provide a BLACS
                                 we can download and install it for you

          --downlapack         : if you do not want to provide a LAPACK
                                 we can download and install it for you

          --notesting          : disables the ScaLAPACK testing. The
                                 BLAS, BLACS and LAPACK libraries are not
                                 required in this case.

          --clean              : cleans up the installer directory.

Note: If you want use a proxy for downloading, the http_proxy environment variable has to be set.

If the required packages cannot be automatically downloaded (for
example, because no network connection is available on the system),
you can take them any way you like from the following URLs and place
them in the build directory (if the directory does not exist, create
it):

BLAS      : http://netlib.org/blas/blas.tgz
LAPACK    : http://netlib.org/lapack/lapack.tgz
BLACS     : http://netlib.org/blacs/mpiblacs.tgz
ScaLAPACK : http://netlib.org/scalapack/scalapack-1.8.0.tgz

Please note that, in the case where the installer is asked to
automatically download and install the BLAS library, the reference
BLAS is installed and, thus, very low performance is to be expected.
It is strongly recommended that you use an highly optimized BLAS
library (like ATLAS, MKL, GotoBLAS, ESSL etc.) and provide a path to
its location through the --blaslib flag.
