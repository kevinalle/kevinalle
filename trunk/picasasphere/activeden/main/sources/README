PhotoSphere sources README

You shouldnt need to recompile the swf, but if you want here is how:

The sources are written in HaXe (http://haxe.org).
Make sure you have HaXe installed correctly in your computer.
You can compile it by simply running
haxe compile.hxml
(or by double-clicking compile.hxml in windows)

Also, the sources are in ActionScript3 format in the folder AS3.
you should be able to compile it with the Flex SDK by running
mxmlc -output photosphere.swf __main__.as
(note: the sources were generated with HaXe's AS3 code generator, http://haxe.org/doc/flash/as3gen)

Good Luck!
